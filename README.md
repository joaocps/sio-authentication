# Authentication project of Information and Organizational Security.

## Resume
The project consists of the design and implementation of a protocol that allows secure communication between two points, with mutual authentication. 

It is intended that it is possible to exchange a file between the client and the server using the protocol, if the server considers that the user has these permissions. The user can authenticate with direct passwords or with the citizen card. 

The server should be able to prove your identity, avoiding MiTM attacks or impersonation.
